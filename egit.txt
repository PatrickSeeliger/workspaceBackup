Using the EGit plugin in Eclipse

To get it to work in Eclipse with EGit behind a firewall there are a few steps:
1. Setup Network Proxy settings:
1.1 Go to Window/Preferences/General/Network Connections
1.2 http and https need to use Provider=Manual, Host=*, Port=80, Authentication=Yes, Username=Windows domain user, Password=...
* look at the IE Internet Options/LAN settings, download the configuration script and select a nearby proxy server

2. Clone the remote repository:
2.1 Specify the URI with .git at the end
2.2 For protocol use http
2.3 For port use 80
2.4 For user specify the Windows domain user**
2.5 For password specify the corresponding password**

** I think this is needed due to an issue with Eclipse/EGit not using username/password from step 1.2. Setting git parameters didn't seem to work, i.e. strict ssl to false and http proxy values
